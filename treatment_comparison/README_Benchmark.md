# Policy Benchmarking System

## Overview

This benchmarking system compares the performance of two treatment policies on the ALPACA (Alzheimer's Prophylactic Action Control Agent) environment:

1. **PPO Agent**: A reinforcement learning agent trained using Proximal Policy Optimization
2. **Clinician Policy**: A Bayesian neural network trained to mimic observed clinician behavior

## Files

- `benchmark_policies.py`: Main benchmarking script
- `test_benchmark_logic.py`: Test script to validate components
- `benchmark_clinician_care.py`: Original objective documentation

## Key Features

### Fair Comparison
- Both policies start from identical initial patient states
- Episodes run for exactly 22 steps (each representing 6-month intervals)
- Same environment dynamics for both policies

### Comprehensive Analysis
1. **Action Differences**: Hamming distance between policy decisions
2. **TRABSCOR Progression**: Cognitive decline tracking over time
3. **Statistical Testing**: Paired t-tests for significance
4. **Medication-Specific Analysis**: Agreement rates per medication type

## Usage

```bash
# Basic run with 100 episodes (default)
python benchmark_policies.py

# Custom configuration
python benchmark_policies.py --num_episodes 50 --output_dir results --seed 42

# Test the system
python test_benchmark_logic.py
```

## Key Metrics

### Primary Outcomes
- **Total Reward**: Environment reward (higher is better)
- **Final TRABSCOR**: Cognitive score at episode end (lower is better)
- **TRABSCOR Change**: Cognitive decline over episode

### Policy Comparison Metrics
- **Action Agreement Rate**: Percentage of identical decisions per medication
- **Hamming Distance**: Number of differing actions per step
- **Statistical Significance**: P-values from paired t-tests

## Expected Results

Based on initial testing, we observe:

1. **PPO Agent Performance**:
   - Better reward outcomes
   - Lower (better) TRABSCOR scores
   - More conservative medication prescribing

2. **Clinician Policy Performance**:
   - More aggressive medication prescribing
   - Higher TRABSCOR (worse cognitive outcomes)
   - Different risk-benefit assessment

3. **Key Disagreements**:
   - Bone Health medications (lowest agreement ~4.5%)
   - PPI medications (low agreement ~11%)
   - Diabetes medications (low agreement ~18%)

4. **High Agreement Areas**:
   - "No Medication" decisions (perfect agreement)
   - Statin prescriptions (~77% agreement)
   - Supplement recommendations (~73% agreement)

## Output Files

The benchmark generates three key files:

1. **`summary_statistics.csv`**: Overall performance metrics
2. **`episode_results.csv`**: Episode-by-episode detailed results
3. **`action_agreement.csv`**: Medication-specific agreement rates

## Interpretation Guidelines

### Statistical Significance
- P-values < 0.05 indicate significant differences
- Effect sizes should be considered alongside significance
- Small sample sizes may affect power

### Clinical Relevance
- TRABSCOR differences of >10 points are clinically meaningful
- Action disagreements of >50% suggest fundamentally different approaches
- Consider real-world applicability of identified differences

### Research Implications
- Identifies areas where RL may outperform clinical practice
- Highlights medications where clinical guidelines may need revision
- Provides evidence for algorithm-assisted treatment decisions

## Technical Details

### Environment
- **State Space**: 23-dimensional continuous observations
- **Action Space**: 17 binary medication decisions
- **Reward Function**: Based on TRABSCOR changes (cognitive preservation)
- **Episode Length**: 22 steps (11 years of treatment)

### Models
- **PPO Agent**: Stable-Baselines3 implementation with VecNormalize
- **Clinician Policy**: Bayesian neural network (3-layer, 512 hidden units)
- **Input Processing**: Direct environment state (23 features)

### Validation
- Both models load successfully
- Environment dynamics are consistent
- Feature alignment is verified
- Statistical calculations are tested

## Future Enhancements

1. **Extended Analysis**:
   - Subgroup analysis by disease stage
   - Temporal pattern analysis
   - Cost-effectiveness evaluation

2. **Model Improvements**:
   - Ensemble methods for uncertainty quantification
   - Multi-objective optimization
   - Hybrid human-AI decision making

3. **Clinical Integration**:
   - Real-world validation studies
   - Prospective clinical trials
   - Regulatory approval pathways

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Model Loading Errors**: Verify file paths and model compatibility
2. **Environment Setup**: Ensure ALPACA directory structure is correct
3. **Memory Issues**: Reduce episode count for limited resources

### Debug Mode
Run the test script first to validate all components:
```bash
python test_benchmark_logic.py
```
